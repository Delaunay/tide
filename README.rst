Kiwi
----

Kiwi is a meta programming language; a program specifier that write
programs for you according to a given specification.

Kiwi is based upon Python, meaning it leverages the Python AST to generate programs
in the target language. The default target language is C++.

> "Within C++, there is a much smaller and clearer language struggling to get out."
    Bjarne Stroustrup

One of the key goal of Kiwi is to show that C++ can be as easy as Python given the
right tools and right idioms, it will show that the worst enemy of C++ is premature
optimization.

Through code generation we aim to be able to generate correct C++ programs
from most pure Python program.
